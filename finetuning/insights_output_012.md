## Architectural Insights

### Leadership Tier Structure Clarified
```
Tier 1: Owner (1 player)
  └─ partymarty94: 463M XP, 25.1k kills

Tier 2: Zenytes (2 players)
  ├─ jakestl314: 304M XP, 6.3k kills
  └─ psilocyn: 233M XP, 693 kills

Tier 3: Deputy Owners (3 players)
  ├─ docofmed: 284M XP, 14.8k kills [STRONGEST DEPUTY]
  ├─ jbwell: 123M XP, 6.2k kills [STRUCTURAL LEADER]
  └─ mtndck: 110M XP, 4.1k kills [GRINDER ACHIEVER]

Context Tier: Key Contributors (1 player)
  └─ vanvolterii: 161M XP, 8.9k kills
```

### Key Discovery from Run 012
- **jbwell's relevance**: 6,226 kills puts them close to jakestl314's 6,316 (zenyte tier), despite lower XP
- **Deputy tier power**: Combined 3 deputies = 518M XP + 25,175 kills (equals owner kill count approximately)
- **Zenyte differentiation**: 9:1 kill ratio between jakestl314 and psilocyn despite both being same rank = role variation

## Next Steps (If Iteration Continues)

### Possible Refinements
1. Add context about WHY these rank distributions matter (governance model)
2. Explore internal deputy dynamics (docofmed's XP vs kill efficiency)
3. Feature comparative narratives about tier bridges (how vanvolterii bridges to deputies)
4. Add historical context (How did these leaders rise to their positions?)

### Quality Assessment Complete
✅ **Run 012 achieves all objectives for leadership-exclusive focus**
✅ **jbwell successfully integrated as 7th leader**
✅ **Prompt constraints working perfectly (asset diversity, format variety)**
✅ **Ready for user validation**

---

**Summary:** Run 012 successfully features all 7 clan leaders with emphasis on rank-based hierarchy, governance structure, and comparative positioning. jbwell's integration as deputy owner completes the leadership roster. All 8 insights use different images and varied narrative formats while maintaining exclusive focus on the named 7 leaders.
