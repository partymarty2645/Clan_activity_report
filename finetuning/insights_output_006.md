Generated: 2025-12-29 (Refined focus: Real achievements over outliers)

## Feedback Applied from Run 005

**User Feedback:**
- ❌ #1: lapislzuli isn't the clan leader → leadership declarations removed

## Prompt Changes

1. **Removed outlier focus**: No more extreme XP/kill ratio stories
2. **Removed leadership claims**: Won't declare leaders based on single metrics
