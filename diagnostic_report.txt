1. Orphaned Data Check
Warning: 549 users have messages but are not in 'clan_members' (Left 
clan or renamed?)

2. Data Staleness (WOM Snapshots)
   Last Snapshot: 2025-12-25T14:56:11.042800+00:00
Staleness check failed: time data "2025-12-23 10:23:36.117000+00:00" 
doesn't match format "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f%z", at position 3. You 
might want to try:
    - passing `format` if your strings have a consistent format;
    - passing `format='ISO8601'` if your strings are all ISO8601 but 
not necessarily in exactly the same format;
    - passing `format='mixed'`, and the format will be inferred for 
each element individually. You might want to use `dayfirst` alongside 
this.

4. Integrity Check: Boss Snapshots
CRITICAL: 3881047/3881047 boss_snapshots have invalid 
'wom_snapshot_id' (Time correlation broken)
